# A Smart, Dumb Phone
My tracfone can't handle any of the cool things the kids do these days.  Or can it?
  
I wrote a Twilio project that accepts commands sent via text and responds with appropriate information (e.g. "weather 12345" -> response with weather at zip 12345).  It's hosted on Heroku.  Now I can ask "Siri" the weather/wikipedia/python/hn by text!
